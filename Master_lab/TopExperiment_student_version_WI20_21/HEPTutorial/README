##########Analysis###########
The analysis is done for mu+jets only because there is not sufficient e+jets events!
########Complie and run#########
The framework works out-of-the-box as follows:
To compile
$ make
To execute
$ ./example.x


############Important Note#########
results_MC.pdf was meant to look at MC signal and background BUT I am using it to draw only signal TRUTH distributions.
results.pdf is MC/data comparison

######Important Notations of plots########
In x-titles of Histograms:
BES (Before Event Selection)
AES (After Event Selection)

######### Nr. Events#########
To get number of events of each process, one has to get it from terminal where the outlayer is self-explanatory


#########To be done#############
If so far everything is alright:
1- Get efficiencies and acceptances in order to perform the x-section calculation
2- Clean up the code and add some options, for ex: write yeilds next to legend
